### Description
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items.
Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
